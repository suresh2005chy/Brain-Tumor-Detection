# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection using ML & CNN

This project is an **AI-powered system for brain tumor detection** using **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans**.  
It applies **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (CNNs)** to classify MRI images as **Tumor** or **No Tumor**, and can be extended to classify tumor subtypes.

---

#  Features
- Preprocessing of MRI images (resizing, normalization, augmentation).
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for feature extraction & classification.
- Comparison with traditional ML classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, etc.).
- Performance evaluation using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**.
- Web app integration using **Flask** for easy MRI scan uploads and predictions.

#  Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Frameworks:** Flask (for deployment), Gunicorn (for production server)  
- **Dataset:** Public MRI datasets (Kaggle Brain MRI dataset, Figshare, Harvard Dataverse)

#  Workflow
1. Dataset Collection â†’ MRI images  
2. Preprocessing â†’ Resize, normalize, augment  
3. Model Training â†’ CNN architecture  
4. Evaluation â†’ Confusion matrix, metrics  
5. Deployment â†’ Flask web app
